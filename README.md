Analyzing the gender gap in representations of AI in the workplace using Sructural Topic Models (STM)

  As an undergraduate research assistant at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the faculty of political science, I used topic modeling to analyze the gender gap in the perceptions of the introduction of AI in the workplace. The study was based on survey data collected from a representative sample of the population in Canada and the US. Due to privacy restrictions, the survey data cannot be shared, and this code cannot be executed outside the repository as it does not include the dataset. 
  The analysis employed Structural Topic Models (STM) to study short written answers (2-5 sentences). Respondents were asked to described the percieved advantages and risks of AI in the workplace as well as its implications for trade and the economy. Consequently, this repository contains two codes using STM on the answers about risks and advantages. Drawing from insights Political Economy, that shown how industrial robotization was seen as a threat among male workers, this study hypothesised that women holding low to middle skilled administrative positions would express the highest levels of apprehensiveness towards the introduction of Ai in the workplace. 
  This research focuses on uncovering thematic patterns and gendered differences in attitudes toward AI. While the findings are not discussed here, the analysis contributes to understanding the intersections of gender, work, and technological change.
